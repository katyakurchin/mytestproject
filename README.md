# Wine Project
## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing the wine quality dataset, specifically the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The analysis aims to explore the relationship between various physicochemical properties of the wine and its quality rating. The dataset includes details on red and white variants of Vinho Verde, providing a comprehensive view of factors that influence wine quality.

## Objectives
- To understand the unique characteristics of the Vinho Verde wine in terms of physicochemical properties and quality.
- To compare red and white wine varieties in terms of quality metrics and chemical composition.
- To employ data science techniques for a nuanced understanding of wine quality determinants.

## Repository Structure
- datasets/: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- analysis_code/: R scripts with the exploratory data analysis.
- renv/: R environment files for replicating the project setup.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Datasets
The project utilizes two datasets:

- winequality-red.csv: Data on red Vinho Verde wine samples.
- winequality-white.csv: Data on white Vinho Verde wine samples.

## Tools and Technologies
- R: Used for data analysis and visualization.
- renv: For R environment management.
- Various R packages including httr, readr, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, and reshape2.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install R and ensure it's properly set up in your system.
- Navigate to the project directory and open R.
- Run renv::restore() to install the necessary packages.
- Execute the scripts or notebooks within the analysis_code/ directory.

## Code Analysis Overview
The analysis involves:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Exploratory data analysis on various wine properties such as acidity levels, sugar content, alcohol content, etc.
- Comparative analysis of red and white Vinho Verde wines.
- Statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
